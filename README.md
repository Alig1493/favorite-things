# favorite-things
The front end portion containing the bare minimum (albeit hacky) 
code to serve a single page application for the 
[favorite things backend](https://github.com/Alig1493/favorites-backend) 
django code.

### Deployment
Using netlify
Link: https://vibrant-lewin-b97ee2.netlify.com/

P.S: This application isn't well built in the sense that it will 
redirect to the list page even if the response to submitting the
form is anything other than 201/200
